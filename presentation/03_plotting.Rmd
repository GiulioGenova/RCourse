## What is &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/logo.png" alt="gglogo" width="140"/>

ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details

{dplyr} and {ggplot2} are part of the tidyverse

## Why using &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/logo.png" alt="gglogo" width="140"/>

    Automatic legends, colors, etc.

    Easy superposition, facetting, etc.

    Nice rendering.

    Store any ggplot2 object for modification or future recall. 
    Super useful for packages.

    Lots of users (less bugs, much help on Stack Overflow).

    Lots of extensions.

    Nice saving option.


## What is the grammar of graphics

Presents a unique foundation for producing almost every quantitative graphic found in scientific journals, newspapers, statistical packages, and data visualization systems

ggplot(data = **DATA**) +                   <br/>
  **GEOM_FUNCTION** (                       <br/>
     mapping = aes(**MAPPINGS**),           <br/>
     stat = **STAT**,                       <br/>
     position = **POSITION**                <br/>
  ) +                                       <br/>
  **COORDINATE_FUNCTION** +                 <br/>
  **FACET_FUNCTION**                        <br/>

You can uniquely describe any plot as a combination of these 7 parameters.

## Help and documentation

Where do I go to find out more about this?

- Official Tidyverse[website](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- ggplot2 [page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
- Nice [presentation](https://privefl.github.io/R-presentation/ggplot2.html#52)
- Nice [talk](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/the-glamour-of-graphics-william-chase
) about designing good looking graphs


## Some Practice now

- We will now go on and take a look at ggplot2 functions and syntax, see some exaples and do some practice

- We can also answer questions and see the excercises from the last lecture
