# load the ggplot2 and the dplyr package with the function library()

# Read the csv soil_data in the data directory assing the data frame to the variable df

# Rename the variables in the dataframe as follows:
# land_use = landuse texture = textabbr_fingprob  ph = ph_cacl2  som = som_elmntprc 
# p = p_calmg100g  k = k_calmg100g

# create a boxplot of p where the categorical variable is the texture

# color the boxplots according to the texture they represent

# add a theme_ of your choice

# save your result in the output directory.
# Hint: there is a ggsave() function in ggplot2
